I'll keep it simple.

Do NOT sell my modpack. You are not allowed to sell my modpack, its code/scripts, or any of its assets. They will never be for sale, nor will they. They already contain copyright material or are edited. Mojang will not allow you to anyways.

Do NOT try to get donations off of my modpack. It is extremely disrespectful to the people who gave me copyright access for their material, and I myself promised that I would never monetize off of them. The Calamity team especially would feel hurt if you did this.

If you do redistribute/modify and reupload Inheriting Nightmares to Curseforge/Modrinth, please credit me. I will not do anything if you don't, its just more of a please.

If you do redistribute/modify and use Inheriting Nightamres code/scripts anywhere, please credit me. I will not do anything if you don't, its just more of a please.
